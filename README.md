3. Run `yarn icons` and `yarn splash`
4. Copy `logo.png` to `android/../drawable`

6. To test FCM messaging, install `fcm-cli`, and get the FCM `TOKEN` from `flutter logs` after the app loads, and `SERVER_KEY` from **Settings > Cloud Messaging**
   ```
   fcm send --server-key SERVER_KEY --to TOKEN --notification.title title --notification.body "`date`" --notification.click_action "FLUTTER_NOTIFICATION_CLICK"
